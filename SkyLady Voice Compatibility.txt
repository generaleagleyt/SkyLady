# SkyLady Voice Compatibility Configuration
# Back up this file before making changes.
# [VoiceMap]
# For male-to-female voice mappings. If an NPC used a male voice on the left side before running the patcher, it will end up with the female voice on the right side.
# You can add more than one voice to the right side, in which case a random one will be chosen.
# [RaceVoiceFallbacks]
# For race-specific fallback voices. If an NPC of the race on the left side contains a custom voice not mapped in [VoiceMap] section, it will randomly receive one of the voices on the right side. Unless you manually add it to the [VoiceMap] section.
# Lines starting with # or empty lines are ignored.
