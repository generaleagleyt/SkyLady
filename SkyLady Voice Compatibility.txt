# SkyLady Voice Compatibility Configuration
# Format:
# [VoiceMap] for male-to-female voice mappings. If an NPC used a male voice on the left side before using SkyLady, it will end up with the female voice on the right side.
# [RaceVoiceFallbacks] for race-specific fallback voices. If an NPC of the race on the left side contains a voice not mapped in [VoiceMap] section, it will randomly choose one of the race's voices on the right side.
# These settings are especially useful for CHIM users.
# Lines starting with # or empty lines are ignored.
